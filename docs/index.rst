SVISE documentation
================================================
The idea behind this package is that everything
should flow through the :ref:`sde-learner-base-label`
class. After defining an instance of this class, 
you can perform stochastic variational inference 
using any combination of prior and approximate 
posterior. Every :ref:`sde-learner-base-label` 
needs a :ref:`SDE prior`, a :ref:`Diffusion prior`,
an approximate posterior over the state in the 
form of a :ref:`Markov Gaussian process`, a  
:ref:`Likelihood`, and a choice of quad rule 
from the list of :ref:`1D Quadrature rules`.

Some useful extras for solving SDEs defined 
by an :ref:`sde-learner-base-label`, 
solving the Lyapunov equations, and 
computing gradients of a parametrized 
skew-symmetric matrix fast are provided in
the :ref:`Utilities`.

Examples can be found in the `experiments`
directory.
